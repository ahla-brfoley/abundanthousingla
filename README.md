# Abundant Housing in LA
This repository contains analyses of Los Angeles housing data for the Abundant Housing in LA pro-housing organization. In the interests of transparency, we're providing the code for all our published, and in-house analyses, and links to the data we're using.

To facilitate exploration, the analyses are split by language, currently [Python](#python_analyses) and [R](#r_analyses). Each analysis is maintained in its own folder, labelled by date posted, and a descriptive caption. Every folder will contain a

## Storage and downloading<a name="storage_downloading"></a>
Because of the size of the datasets we're analysing, and because they may be repeatedly updated, we won't store them into the main repository. They will be downloaded, on an as-needed basis, into users' `./localdata` folders. Note that `gitignore` is set to ignore the contents of `./localdata`. All analyses should access the data files in `./localdata/*` by relative path. Filenames and version names should be consistent across analyses. We can either host the files on github, or download them from the original source (this might cause trouble with versions?).
