# R guidelines

## Recommended packages
Where possible, we should try and use a common set of packages. This will make our analyses more comparable, and will build up a level of shared expertise that will help us check each others' work, and help each other with problems.

Some of these packages have complicated dependencies. We should document these for linux, Windows and
