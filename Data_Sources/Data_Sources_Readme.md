# Description

There are a number of excellent housing-relevant datasets available. These may require specialised api queries and processing. Data sets, data sources, and any queries we expect to use often should be separated from the main analysis and detailed here.

## Data Sources

### American Community Survey

[The American community survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) is a yearly survey that provides a wealth of hyperlocal data on demographics and community composition. It comes aggregated at 1, 3, and 5 year levels. This is theoretically the authoritative, and theoretically the best, source of data for modelling housing and economic effects. However, the amount and complexity of the data is nontrivial. 

It would be great to work 

### Neighborhood Data For Social Change (NDSC)
